📊 Time Series Forecasting Project

Introduction
This project focuses on building and evaluating time series forecasting models to predict future values based on historical data. It uses popular machine learning and statistical techniques for forecasting.

Project Overview
📁 Dataset: [Stock prices]
⚙️ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit
📈 Models Used:
ARIMA
SARIMA
Prophet
LSTM 

The notebook walks through:
Data preprocessing and visualization
Model training and forecasting
Evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE
Deployment as an interactive Streamlit app

Conclusion
The developed models provide accurate forecasts for the given dataset, helping in better planning and decision-making. The Streamlit interface allows users to interactively view predictions and model comparisons.

🔍 Interpretation: LSTM is clearly the best model:
Lowest MSE, RMSE, and MAE → it has the least error.
R² = 0.987 → means the model explains 98.7% of the variance in the test data. Excellent fit!
Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMA performed poorly:
All have negative R², meaning they performed worse than just predicting the average.
High errors (especially Prophet with MSE over 582 and RMSE over 24).

📌 Conclusion: Your LSTM model is significantly more accurate and reliable than the traditional time series models (Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA) for this dataset. It would be the preferred choice for making future predictions.
